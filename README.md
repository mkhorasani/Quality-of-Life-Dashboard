## What is the question the dashboard is design to answer?
This dashboard will help people decide which country they can live in by displaying the quality of life index  vs. the purchasing power index and property price to income ratio index for each country. Knowing how wealthy they are, they can determine the country with the highest quality of life that they would financially be able to live in.

## What kinds of data (e.g. categorical, ordinal, quantitative continuous, quantitative discrete, etc.) are displayed in each chart, and why, based on its data, did you choose each chart type (e.g. bar chart, line chart, area chart, table, scatterplot, etc.)
There are three charts in this dashboard. The first two charts are scatterplots that display the quality of life index vs. the purchasing power index and property price to income ratio index for each country. Given that all of the indices are continous data, it was necessary to use a scatterplot for both charts. The third chart is a map of the world that displays the color coded quality of life index, and also contains the data for purchasing power index and propetry to income ratio index. 

## How does your dashboard allow the viewer to perform cross-filtering?
This dashboard allows the viewer to select an area on the map, i.e. North America, and accordingly the selected countries will be highlighted in the scatterplots. Similarly, the viewer can select a point or  series of points and the scatter plot, and the accordinly countried will be highlighted on the map.

## How does your dashboard allow the viewer to get details on demand?
This dashboard allows the viewer to click on any country on the map or on any point on the scatterplots, and the exact data for that country or point will be displayed, i.e. country name, quality of life index, purchasing power index and property to income ratio index.

## Why did you layout the charts in the dashboard the way you did?
The scatterplots were displayed at the top in a horizontal manner, since there are two scatterplots that both show the quality of life index vs. another parameter, therefore they need to be side by side for comparison. The map was displayed below the scatterplot since it is considered to be a supplementary overview to the scatterplots. The legends were displayed on the right and not on the charts in order to avoid any occlusion.

## Are effective color palettes chosen and is the data shown in the context of an overview?
The color palletes used both on the map and scatterplots, are blue-orange dividing, since countries with relatively better indicies are shown in blue and ones with poorer indicies are shown in orange. In addition sizing is used in the scatterplot to show countries that have a better quality of life index. An average line allows the viewer to visulize strongly and poorly performing countries. The scatterplots are supplemented by the world map which os considered to be the overview of the data.

## Are the axes and legends appropriately labeled?
The axes and legends are labeled with the exact information provided by the dataset.
